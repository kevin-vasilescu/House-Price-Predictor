[![CI](https://github.com/your-username/house-prices-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-username/house-prices-repo/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This repository contains a complete, end-to-end machine learning project for predicting house sale prices based on the [Kaggle "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques).

The project includes data exploration, feature engineering, model training (Linear Regression, XGBoost, Neural Network), evaluation, and a Streamlit web application for interactive predictions.



## ðŸš€ Quickstart

Follow these steps to set up the project, train the models, and run the web app.

**Prerequisites:**
* Python 3.10+
* A Kaggle account and API token (`kaggle.json`)
