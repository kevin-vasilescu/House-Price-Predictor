## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict house prices accurately using a combination of exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and machine learning models. By leveraging historical real estate data, this project provides insights and predictions that can help buyers, sellers, and investors make informed decisions.

Key objectives:  
- Analyze and visualize housing market trends  
- Engineer meaningful features for machine learning  
- Train, evaluate, and compare predictive models  
- Deploy a web application for real-time predictions  

---

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Detailed analysis of housing data including distributions, correlations, and key trends.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Transform raw data into features that improve model performance, including neighborhood, property size, and age of house.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and compare multiple models such as Linear Regression, XGBoost, and Neural Networks.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to identify the best-performing algorithm.  
- **Web Deployment:** Streamlit application for user-friendly, real-time house price predictions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-house-prices.git
cd github-house-prices

2. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run docker container for deployment

docker build -t house-price-predictor .
docker run -p 8501:8501 house-price-predictor

Usage
	•	Exploration: Open Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ to analyze the data and experiment with models.
	•	Training: Use scripts in src/ to train models on the dataset.
	•	Prediction: Launch the Streamlit app with:

streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py

Data

The dataset contains historical housing data with features including:
	•	Property size (square footage)
	•	Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
	•	Neighborhood and location coordinates
	•	Age of the house
	•	Other relevant real estate metrics

⸻

Modeling

Models implemented include:
	•	Linear Regression
	•	XGBoost Regressor
	•	Neural Networks

Evaluation metrics include RMSE, MAE, and R². All models are compared to select the best-performing approach.

⸻

Deployment

The Streamlit app allows users to input property details and instantly receive predicted house prices. The app can be deployed locally or on cloud services such as Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
